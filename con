This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. 
Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. 
The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets. We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive active learning and traditional machine learning approaches.
Our results show that..We conclude that..

Today there exists many billions of galaxies. How did they form? To answer that question, over many years astronomers have used the fundamental laws of physics to deduce the basic story of galaxy formation. 
The formation process had begun with huge clouds of gas and dust. As these clouds collapse under gravity,
the gas becomes denser and heats up, leading to the formation of stars. Overtime, smaller galaxies collide
and merge which allows them to grow into large structures.

    <pre>
As mentioned already, galaxies formed from an initial gas cloud, followed by star formation and then ending in merging and growth (hierarchical merging). 
Dark matter has played a big role in galaxy formation. It is an invisible form of matter whose total mass in the universe is roughly five times that of “normal” matter (i.e. atoms).
It acts as a scaffolding of the universe and the visible matter simply collects inside of that scaffolding, In the form of stars and galaxies. Dark matter does this, by clumping together; in which small objects form first and are drawn together to form larger ones.
